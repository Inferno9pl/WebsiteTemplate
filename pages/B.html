                In this gritty and violent new story from the award-winning creators of The Walking Dead â€“ A Telltale Games Series, you'll
                make discoveries that will shatter Bruce Wayne's world, and the already fragile stability of a corrupt Gotham
                City.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your actions and your choices will determine the fate of the Batman.

                The player takes the role of Batman, both as the superhero and as his alter ego Bruce Wayne. Telltale Games CEO Kevin Bruner
                has stated that playtime will be split evenly between them, though at times the game will offer the player
                a choice of whether to approach a situation as Wayne or as Batman. The game's narrative offers a
                "fresh interpretation of the universe set in current times, not tied to any existing iteration of Batman
                in games, film, or comics", according to Telltale Games.According to Bruner, the game is set a few years
                after Wayne decides to become Batman, giving them flexibility in their writing and gameplay to give the player
                some control on how they want to play the character without ties to any established narrative. The game
                features a branching narrative, similar to past Telltale games, giving the player options in approaching
                a situation and having that choice affect later events in the game. The game includes action sequences
                that are resolved similar to Telltale's other games, using quick time events. The series also includes investigation
                sequences, allowing the player to use Batman's detective skills to progress the story.

                The series also introduces a new feature called "crowd play", available on both the PC and console versions of the game.
                Crowd play allows the game to be watched by an audience who can participate in the decision-making process.
                When this feature is active, the player provides their audience with a link to Telltale's website with a
                unique code to participate in that session through any web-enabled device. These additional players are given
                the option to vote at the game's decision points, with the results presented to the main player to judge
                which decision to make. Optionally, the main player can have the game automatically take the most-popular
                decision for them.
