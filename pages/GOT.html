                This new story tells of House Forrester, a noble family from the north of Westeros, loyal to the Starks of Winterfell. Caught
                up in the events surrounding the War of the Five Kings, they are thrown into a maelstrom of bloody warfare,
                revenge, intrigue, and horror as they fight to survive while the seven kingdoms tear themselves apart. You
                will take on the role of different members of the Forrester household, and determine their fate through the
                choices you make; your actions and decisions will change the story around you.
