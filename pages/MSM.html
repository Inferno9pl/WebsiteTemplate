                The game follows the episodic format that Telltale Games used for its titles: The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales
                from the Borderlands, and Game of Thrones. The game centers around a new character named Jesse, who can be
                either male or female, as they and their allies attempt to save their world by defeating the Wither Storm.
