            Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is the first of The
            Walking Dead video game series published by Telltale.

            <p>The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with events occurring shortly after the onset
                of the zombie apocalypse in Georgia. However, most of the characters are original to the game, which centers
                on university professor and convicted criminal Lee Everett, who helps to rescue and subsequently care for
                a young girl named Clementine. Kirkman provided oversight for the game's story to ensure it corresponded
                to the tone of the comic, but allowed Telltale to handle the bulk of the developmental work and story specifics.
                Some characters from the original comic book series also make in-game appearances.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike many graphic adventure games, The Walking Dead does not emphasize puzzle solving, but instead focuses
                on story and character development. The story is affected by both the dialogue choices of the player and
                their actions during quick time events, which can often lead to, for example, certain characters being killed,
                or an adverse change in the disposition of a certain character or characters towards Lee. The choices made
                by the player carry over from episode to episode. Choices were tracked by Telltale, and used to influence
                their writing in later episodes.
            </p>
            <p>The Walking Dead has been critically acclaimed, with reviewers praising the harsh emotional tone of the story
                and the empathetic connection established between Lee and Clementine. It won year-end accolades, including
                Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. More than one million unique players have purchased
                at least one episode from the series, with over 8.5 million individual units sold by the end of 2012, and
                its success has been seen as constituting a revitalization of the weakened adventure game genre. In July
                2013, Telltale released an additional downloadable episode, 400 Days, to extend the first season and bridge
                the gap towards the second season. The third season premiered on December 20, 2016. The fourth and final
                season is set to be released in 2018.
